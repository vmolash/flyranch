    <h1>Six Exceptional Artists to Create Artworks For Charleston East Plaza</h1>
    <p>Over the last two years, Burning Man Project’s Civic Arts team has had the opportunity to collaborate with Google to develop the plan for installing six art projects in the new public Charleston East Plaza in Mountain View, California. Our work involved a six-month community engagement process, an international call for artists, and an art selection and review process.</p>
    <p>We are now pleased to announce the selection of six artworks and the deployment of $1.5 million to support six amazing artist teams as they bring these artworks to life. These are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Marc Fornes, THEVERYMANY, Anchor Artwork (Untitled)</li>
        <li>Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson Art, “Curious”</li>
        <li>Michael Szivos, SOFTLab, “Halo”</li>
        <li>Hou de Sousa,  “Go”</li>
        <li>Zachary Coffin, “Rockspinner”</li>
        <li>Julian Voss-Andreae, “Quantum Meditation II”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The artworks will be fabricated in 2020 and installed in 2021. For those in the Burner, Google and local communities who are interested in participating, there will be opportunities to help with the fabrication and installation of some of these projects, including “Curious” by Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, and “Go” by Hou de Sousa. Stay tuned for those engagement opportunities, as well as the celebration of the opening of Charleston East Plaza later in 2021.</p>
